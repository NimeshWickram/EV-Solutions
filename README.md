# EV-Solutions

A responsive website built with **React.js** and **Vite** to showcase electric vehicle (EV) solutions, developed as a learning project to practice frontend development. This project demonstrates my ability to implement a functional web application using React components, Vite‚Äôs efficient build system, and CSS styling.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **React Components**: Includes reusable components for pages like \[e.g., Home, Services; customize based on your pages\].
- **Fast Development**: Utilizes Vite for rapid setup and hot module replacement.
- **EV-Focused Content**: Displays information about electric vehicle solutions, such as \[e.g., products, services; customize based on content\].
- **CSS Styling**: Styled with vanilla CSS for a clean and modern appearance.
- **Interactive Elements**: Features \[e.g., navigation menu, buttons; add specific features from the project\].

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized production builds.
- **CSS**: For responsive and visually appealing styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For interactivity and application logic.
- **Node.js & npm**: For dependency management and development server.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NimeshWickram/EV-Solutions.git
   cd EV-Solutions
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the displayed port) in your browser.

4. **Build for Production** (optional):

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The optimized build will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Usage

- Navigate the website to explore EV solutions content, such as \[e.g., service details, product pages; customize based on your project\].
- Developers can edit components in the `src/` folder or modify styles in `[src/assets or CSS files]` to extend functionality.
- Deploy the build to platforms like Vercel or Netlify for public access.

- Developed and organized reusable React components for a web application.
- Learned Vite‚Äôs development and build workflows for efficient coding.
- Applied CSS to create responsive and user-friendly designs.
- Used Git and GitHub for version control, including repository setup and commits.
- Followed a guided resource to understand practical frontend development techniques.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
